1. CREATE DATABASE demo;

2. DROP DATABASE demo;

3. USE finkployd;

4. CREATE TABLE demo (
	first_column INT
);

5. ALTER TABLE demo ADD second_column VARCHAR(255);

6. DROP TABLE demo;

7. CREATE TABLE artists (
	id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

8. CREATE TABLE albums (
	id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	year INT,
	artist_id INT NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (id),
	FOREIGN KEY (artist_id) REFERENCES artists(id)
);

Thanks to FOREIGN KEY we can't create an album with
an artist that doesn't exist in artists table. Also
if you try to delete an artist, SQL will tell you that
you can't, because there are albums linked to it. In this
case you would have to delete the artist and all albums
linked to that artist.

9. INSERT INTO artists (name) VALUES ('Led Zeppelin');

10. INSERT INTO artists (name)
	VALUES ('Black Sabbath'), ('King Crimson');
